### Talk Details

**Title**: Workflow into Go (lol? I'm terrible with naming)

**Abstract**: (300 words)

**Talk Format**: Workshop

**Audience Level**: Beginner

--------------------------

**Description**: (schedule)
*The description will be seen by reviewers during the CFP process and may eventually be seen by the attendees of the event.*
*You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.*

[This could be the description possibly?](GopherConWorkshop.md)


## Ideal Student
This workshop is for individuals with little to no programming experience! Attendees do not need to have studied Computer Science, be familiar with another programming language, or even be completely sure what programming is all about. 

--------------------------

**Notes**: (mention)
*Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...*

- I could write a bit on why quotes could be a good project (uplifting, a tool that could be easily shown off to others and used for fun, lots of opportunity for I/O manipulation, and is easily extensible)
- More details on the theory for why starting with a workflow based training would be so useful (and novel)
- Description of Capital One's Tech College and the goals we have for training?
    - we could also mention sponsoring attendees to come out - although maybe that's not what you should put in the proposal?
- A bit about connecting the attendees with mentors
- Think that this is a good segue into resources like exercism and want to encourage the attendees to continue their development after the conference
