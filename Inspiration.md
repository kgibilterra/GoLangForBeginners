## Learning to program with Python

The more I research, the more wonderful I think the Python community is and their model can be used for a lot of learnings

- [Real Python - First Steps](https://realpython.com/learn/python-first-steps/) 
    - $60 for the materials
    - $400 for the materials and 3 one-on-one mentoring sessions
    - "We start with the syntax - both 2.7 and 3.5 - to provide you with a solid base to stand on. Then, moving on to web development, you’ll learn database programming with SQL, web scraping, REST fundamentals, and much more before moving on to three powerful web frameworks: Flask, web2py, and Django. Finally, after you’ve developed a number of web apps, we move on to advanced web development where we teach software craftsmanship with Django. Essentially, you will learn best practices while building an enterprise-grade web app utilizing a number of tools like Bootstrap, Git, Heroku, Angular, Vagrant, Travis CI, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, to name a few."

## Additional Resources
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) - HTML5, CSS, JS, Databases (Mongo), Git & Github, Node.js, React.js, D3.js
    - They have a "Computer Basics" section that is really interesting. This sort of training would really help with establishing common langauge
- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Go is not on here
- [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) - lots of Go! But I don't know if it is accessible to actual beginners
