# Workshop Goals

## 1 Day Workshop

### Assumptions / Questions:
- Target Audience: people that are completely new to programming
- General Assumption: They have not used a terminal before, but have used folders? (in previous teaching I have met people relatively regularly that do not use folders on their computer - yay cloud)
- How do we sync up among people from various levels of backgrounds?


### Sample Goals: 
- Focus on understanding the environment that they are programming in, learning the syntax will be easier after that. 
- Provide opinionated guildelines for getting started so that they can learn the foundations for their programs and feel confident to ignore programmers that might try to put them down with frivolous statements "real programmers use vim," etc.


### Potential skills we want them to walk away feeling comfortable with:
- VS Code (?)
- going from source code to standard library
- setting up their environment and understanding what the variables/settings are about?
- understanding what is happening when they run a program - what does a build do
- what is a binary
- devops / architecture documents?
- very basics of go syntax
    - maybe just variables, loops, standard IO?


### Considerations
- It is often more fun to be able to visualize what you are building when you are new - should we try to encorporate that into Go?
    - CLI tools could be a good start 
- Understanding the "how/why" behind things working could cause some people to lose interest?
- How do we encourage them to continue learning Go after the session


### Other Program Styles
- 2 Day Program 
- Weekly sessions
- Online open course
